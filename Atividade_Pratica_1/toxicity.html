		<h1>Toxicity</h1>
		<h2>System of a Down</h2>
		<h3>Toxicity</h3>

		<p>Conversion, software version 7.0<br/>
		Looking at life through the eyes of a tire hub,<br/>
		Eating seeds as a past time activity,<br/>
		The toxicity of our city, of our city,</p>

		<p>Now, what do you own the world?<br/>
		How do you own disorder, disorder,<br/>
		Now, somewhere between the sacred silence,<br/>
		Sacred silence and sleep,<br/>
		Somewhere, between the sacred silence and sleep,<br/>
		Disorder, disorder, disorder.</p>

		<p>More wood for their fires, loud neighbors,<br/>
		Flashlight reveries<br/>
		Caught in the headlights of a truck,<br/>
		Eating seeds as a past time activity,<br/>
		The toxicity of our city, of our city,</p>

		<p>You, what do you own the world?<br/>
		How do you own disorder, disorder,<br/>
		Now, somewhere between the sacred silence,<br/>
		Sacred silence and sleep,<br/>
		Somewhere, between the sacred silence and sleep,<br/>
		Disorder, disorder, disorder.</p>

		<p>You, what do you own the world?<br/>

		Sacred silence and sleep,<br/>
		Somewhere, between the sacred silence and sleep,<br/>
		Disorder, disorder, disorder.</p>

		<p>When I became the sun,<br/>
		I shone life into the man's hearts,<br/>
		When I became the sun,<br/>
		I shone life into the man's hearts.</p>
